# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves creating a sophisticated multi-agent system using LangChain and LangGraph that can intelligently route questions to specialized agents (Analyst, Architect, Developer, Code Reviewer, Tester) based on the nature of the request. The system will feature configurable prompts, RAG capabilities with vector and graph databases, and a rich CLI interface for user interaction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Base Agent Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a foundational agent framework using LangChain and LangGraph, so that I can extend it to create specialized agents with consistent behavior and communication patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL create a base agent class using LangChain components
2. WHEN extending the base agent THEN the system SHALL support LangGraph integration for workflow management
3. WHEN agents are created THEN they SHALL inherit common functionality from the base agent
4. WHEN agents communicate THEN they SHALL use standardized message formats and protocols

### Requirement 2: Specialized Agent Types

**User Story:** As a user, I want different types of specialized agents (Analyst, Architect, Developer, Code Reviewer, Tester), so that my questions can be handled by the most appropriate expert agent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize an Analyst agent for routing and classification
2. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize an Architect agent for solution design and explanation
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize a Developer/Implementer agent for code generation
4. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize a Code Reviewer agent for code analysis and feedback
5. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize a Tester agent for test creation and validation
6. WHEN an agent is created THEN it SHALL have specialized prompts and capabilities for its role

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Routing System

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Analyst agent to automatically categorize my questions and route them to the appropriate specialist agent, so that I get the most relevant and expert response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a question THEN the Analyst agent SHALL analyze and categorize the request
2. WHEN the Analyst completes categorization THEN it SHALL route the question to the appropriate specialist agent
3. WHEN routing occurs THEN the system SHALL support routing to Architect, Developer, Code Reviewer, or Tester based on question type
4. WHEN routing is ambiguous THEN the Analyst SHALL request clarification or route to multiple agents
5. WHEN routing is complete THEN the target agent SHALL receive the original question with routing context

### Requirement 4: Inter-Agent Communication

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want agents to be able to communicate and collaborate with each other, so that complex questions can be handled through coordinated multi-agent workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents need to collaborate THEN they SHALL be able to send messages to other agents
2. WHEN an agent receives a message from another agent THEN it SHALL process and respond appropriately
3. WHEN multi-agent workflows are needed THEN the system SHALL coordinate agent interactions using LangGraph
4. WHEN agents collaborate THEN they SHALL maintain conversation context and history
5. WHEN collaboration is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a unified response to the user

### Requirement 5: Configurable Prompt Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want externalized and configurable prompts stored in a separate directory, so that I can easily modify agent behavior without changing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL load prompts from a dedicated promptDir directory
2. WHEN prompts are needed THEN agents SHALL retrieve them from external files rather than hardcoded strings
3. WHEN prompt files are modified THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading or restart-based updates
4. WHEN different agent types are used THEN each SHALL have its own prompt files organized by role
5. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate that all required prompt files exist and are readable

### Requirement 6: Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want the system to be configurable via environment variables and .env files, so that I can easily deploy and configure the system across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from .env files using dotenv
2. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL support environment variables for all configurable parameters
3. WHEN API keys are required THEN they SHALL be loaded securely from environment variables
4. WHEN database connections are needed THEN connection strings SHALL be configurable via environment
5. WHEN prompt directories are specified THEN their paths SHALL be configurable through environment variables

### Requirement 7: RAG Integration with Vector Database

**User Story:** As a user, I want the agents to have access to relevant context through RAG using ChromaDB, so that they can provide more informed and accurate responses based on stored knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL connect to ChromaDB for vector storage and retrieval
2. WHEN agents need context THEN they SHALL query ChromaDB for relevant documents and information
3. WHEN documents are ingested THEN they SHALL be properly vectorized and stored in ChromaDB
4. WHEN similarity search is performed THEN the system SHALL return the most relevant context for the query
5. WHEN RAG is used THEN agents SHALL incorporate retrieved context into their responses

### Requirement 8: Graph RAG with Neo4j

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to support graph-based RAG using Neo4j, so that agents can understand and leverage relationships between concepts and entities in their responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL connect to Neo4j for graph-based knowledge storage
2. WHEN agents need relational context THEN they SHALL query Neo4j for connected information
3. WHEN knowledge graphs are built THEN they SHALL represent entities and their relationships accurately
4. WHEN graph queries are executed THEN they SHALL return relevant connected information for context
5. WHEN both vector and graph RAG are available THEN agents SHALL intelligently choose the appropriate retrieval method

### Requirement 9: Rich CLI Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want a command-line interface with rich text formatting and proper code highlighting, so that I can interact with the agents in a visually appealing and readable way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLI starts THEN it SHALL provide a rich text interface using appropriate libraries
2. WHEN code is displayed THEN it SHALL be properly syntax highlighted and formatted
3. WHEN agents respond THEN their output SHALL be formatted with appropriate colors and styling
4. WHEN users input questions THEN the CLI SHALL provide a clear and intuitive input interface
5. WHEN long responses are provided THEN the CLI SHALL handle pagination and scrolling appropriately

### Requirement 10: UV Package Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to use UV for environment and package management, so that I have fast and reliable dependency management and virtual environment handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN it SHALL use UV to create and manage the virtual environment
2. WHEN dependencies are needed THEN they SHALL be installed and managed through UV
3. WHEN the project is distributed THEN it SHALL include proper UV configuration files
4. WHEN environments are created THEN UV SHALL handle Python version management and isolation
5. WHEN packages are updated THEN UV SHALL manage dependency resolution and conflicts

### Requirement 11: LangGraph Workflow Creation

**User Story:** As a system designer, I want agents to be able to create and execute LangGraph workflows dynamically, so that complex multi-step processes can be handled automatically based on question requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complex questions are received THEN agents SHALL be able to create appropriate LangGraph workflows
2. WHEN workflows are created THEN they SHALL define clear steps and agent interactions
3. WHEN workflows execute THEN they SHALL coordinate multiple agents in the correct sequence
4. WHEN workflows complete THEN they SHALL provide comprehensive results to the user
5. WHEN workflow errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and provide meaningful feedback
